# Energy-Consumption-Analysis
### Project Summary

This project on energy consumption in South Carolina and North Carolina has revealed key insights and effective strategies for reducing energy usage. Significant factors influencing energy consumption were identified through detailed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering, including economic status, climate zones, and building characteristics.

Key findings include:

1. **Targeted Interventions**: Promoting energy efficiency, especially in lower-income households, through incentives for energy-efficient appliances, renewable energy solutions, and tiered energy pricing.
   
2. **Awareness Campaigns**: Educating households, particularly higher-income ones, about the environmental impact of excessive energy consumption and ways to reduce it, to encourage sustainable energy practices.

3. **Comprehensive Approach**: Emphasizing the importance of considering economic, environmental, and social factors in energy management to achieve a sustainable and energy-efficient future for the region.

By implementing these insights and strategies, policymakers and energy providers can foster a more sustainable energy future for both states.
